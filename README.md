# Project-3-Front-End

Users will be able to post and edit recipes (only if they made an account/login) and they are able to view recipes that other users have posted!

Technologies Used: Frontend was built with React.js while the backend was built using Express.js, Mongoose, and bCrypt.

Current bugs: edit form does not refresh upon submit, so you have to clear out one form before editing another recipe.

Future additions: adding buttons to display/hide the login and create account forms, adding the ability for logged in users to make comments on each recipe
